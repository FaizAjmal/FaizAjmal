## 🚀 About Me

I'm a student passionate about Computer Science and problem-solving. I believe in learning by doing, so I'm starting with small projects (like converters, calculators) and gradually moving to larger applications.

- 🎯 **Goal:** To become a Data Scientist
- 💡 **Currently exploring:** Web Dev basics + CS fundamentals
- 🌱 **Building:** A portfolio step by step — everything is public here
- 🤝 **Open to:** Feedback and collaborations on beginner-friendly projects
